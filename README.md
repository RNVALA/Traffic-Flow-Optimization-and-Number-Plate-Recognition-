# Problem Statement

With the increasing population and number of automobiles in cities, traffic congestion has become a major issue. Traffic jams not only cause delays and stress for drivers but also contribute to increased fuel consumption and air pollution. In order to address this problem, a Computer Vision-based traffic signal controller has been developed to improve traffic management. The system aims to automatically adapt to the traffic situation at the traffic signal by allocating time to specific lanes based on the density of traffic.
